# - For a quick test do the following (assuming your world is called "world"):
# -   1.  enter "/hotblock enable world" on the server console
# -   2.  Place a blue concrete block on the ground
# -   3. Jump onto this block
# - As a result the block changes its color to red imediatly and vanishs 2 seconds later

startup:

   # Use Passive mode
   #
   # - In passive mode the plugin engine is not initialized,
   # - only the Java objects are avail.
   # - You had to instanciate your own orchestratator

   # - Use this option only if you customize the Java objects itself 
   passiveMode: false
